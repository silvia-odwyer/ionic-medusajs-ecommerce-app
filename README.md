## Get Started
To run the application, firstly clone this repository and move into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/ionic-medusajs-ecommerce-app
cd ionic-medusajs-ecommerce-app
```

Next, install the dependencies required:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start Ionic Lab, which displays mobile previews for iOS and Android. It also 
supports live reloading, so when you make changes to the codebase, the app will reload and update.

```bash
ionic serve --lab
```

A new browser window will open at http:localhost:8100, and the app is ready to go!
